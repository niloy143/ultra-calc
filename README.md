## Time Complexity

- compareNumber() => O(N) where N is the length of both number
- digitEqualizer() => O(N\*M) where N is the length of both number and M is total input numbers
- popZeroes() and shiftZeroes() => O(N) where N is the number of zeroes to remove
- add() => O(N) where N is the length of both number
- addition() => O(N) where N is the length of both number
- subtract() => O(N) where N is the length of both number
- subtraction() => O(N) where N is the length of both number
- multiplication() => O(N\*(M+N)) where N is the length of the smallest number, M is the length of the biggest number
